When designing a system or apps, its important for teams to set specific measurable targets/goals to hel organizations strike the right balance between product development and operation work.
These targets help consumers and end users quantify the level of reliability they should come to expect from a service.
# Service Level Indicator (SLI)
Quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.
Like a metric to measure the quality of service.
- Common SLIs:
-> Request Latency
-> Error Rate
-> Saturation 
-> Throughput
-> Availability

# Service Level Object(SLO)
Target value or range for an SLI
Example:
SLI is Latency
SLO Latency > 100ms

SLI is Availability
SLO 99,9% uptime

=> Related to customer

# Service Level Agreement (SLA)
Contract between a vendor and a user that guarantees a certain SLO.
